Some steps may vary depending on the type of property you buy, but in general these are the steps you can expect as you begin your home buying journey in Queens NY. Need help? Feel free to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://homeandhabitatrealty.com/contact-us\"><strong>Contact Us</strong></a>&nbsp;anytime.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Step 1</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Talk to a lender.</strong>&nbsp;If you&rsquo;re looking to buy a property in Queens, the first thing you need to do is find out if you can actually afford to buy. This can be done by getting a pre-qualification or a pre-approval. Without this step, you&rsquo;re really just shooting in the dark. You&rsquo;d be surprised, some buyers can qualify for more then they expected, and other buyers think they can get approved for more than they actually can. A mortgage lender will ask you about your income, financial statements, credit, employment history, other properties owned, etc. Many people do this years before they buy because even if the mortgage lender tells you that you can&rsquo;t get a loan, at least you will know what you need to do in order to become qualified. They will tell you what to do to get on the path to homeownership and that is a key first step. If you need any lender recommendations, we have plenty.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Step 2</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Talk to an agent.</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;Once you find out if you qualify for a loan, your next step should be to speak with a local agent who is full time, specializes in working with buyers, and knows the areas that you&rsquo;re looking in. They&rsquo;ll be able to tell you if what you&rsquo;re looking for is actually realistic based on your pre-approval amount.&nbsp;If so, then they will likely be able to help you find a great property. On the other hand, if your approval amount is not realistic for the areas that you&rsquo;re looking in, then a good buyer agent will be able to help you identify other areas that can still meet your lifestyle needs.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Step 3</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Schedule a buyer consultation.&nbsp;</strong>Most people skip this step but it is SO important. You&rsquo;d be surprised how much you (and your agent) can learn once you sit down to talk through your ideas, must haves, lifestyle, etc. The initial consultation usually takes about an hour and in that time, a good buyer&rsquo;s agent will ask you all sorts of questions to find out more about exactly what you&rsquo;re looking for, and whether they think it is possible to find in that in the market of that moment. The consultation is key because without one, you and your agent will be learning things one the fly and this ultimately leads to a lot of wasted time seeing properties that you have no interest in. A good buyer consultation should cut your home search in half, and if done right, you should be able to find the right property within 10 showings. FYI: Buyer consultations are typically free so you should never have to pay for one.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Step 4</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Decide to buy.</strong>&nbsp;Once you meet with an agent and go over all your needs, you should have a good idea as to whether or not you are really ready to buy. If you come to the realization that you aren&rsquo;t ready, that&rsquo;s completely normal, and at that point, what you want to do is keep preparing so that when you enter the market you can find and buy something that you&rsquo;ll be happy with. On the other hand, if you realize that you are indeed ready to buy, then the next step is to get out there and start viewing properties!&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Step 5</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Start viewing properties.</strong>&nbsp;Once you decide to buy, you can get out there &amp; actively start looking at properties. TIP: Don&rsquo;t look at anything over your budget, unless you know it&rsquo;s a pronounced buyer&rsquo;s market. Also, be open to doing some work. Truth is that houses and apartments in Queens are old and if you require a completely move-in ready home, it will likely take you years to find the right place. Our advice, if you see a property you really like and it&rsquo;s priced right, chances are someone else feels the same way so don&rsquo;t hesitate to put in a strong offer to win the bid. We&rsquo;ve seen people pay over asking price for a home and then a year or two later they already gained more than the difference in appreciation.&nbsp;We also see a lot of people who lose out on properties and then feel the regret of not being more aggressive for the property they loved. A good buyer agent will be a great partner while you view properties too because good buyer agents will point out aspects of the property that you may not see or know about.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Step 6</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Make and negotiate offers</strong>. Once you see a property you like, you&rsquo;ll probably want to make an offer. This is where it&rsquo;s very important that you understand agency because a seller&rsquo;s agent (or listing agent) will always want you to pay the most money possible, while a buyer&rsquo;s agent will be able to help you determine the right offer price, analyze the market, share comps with you, give you their opinion, etc. Only a buyer&rsquo;s agent that you have hired to represent you can do that, a broker or seller&rsquo;s agent will not be able to.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Step 7</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Schedule inspection &amp; do your due diligence.&nbsp;</strong>Once you have an accepted offer, it&rsquo;s time for you and your agent to do some due diligence. This includes things like conducting a home inspection, checking for open violations, non-permitted items, certificate of occupancies, etc. A good buyer&rsquo;s agent will help you with this. A seller&rsquo;s agent, broker&rsquo;s agent, or non-experienced agent will most likely not help much with this type of due diligence.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Step 8</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Hire a real estate attorney.&nbsp;</strong>Once you have an accepted offer you should start vetting attorneys because as soon as you get through the due diligence period, you will need to notify them. At this point, the listing agent will ask you or your agent for your attorney&rsquo;s contact info and they will include it on the deal sheet which goes out to both buyer and seller attorneys.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PRO TIP: Make sure you use a Real Estate Attorney. We&rsquo;ve seen a lot of buyers lose their deal because they chose an attorney who doesn&rsquo;t specialize in real estate or is not familiar with Queens&rsquo; real estate and as a result, they end up dragging things out or making things way more complicated then they need to be. Most Queens real estate attorneys know how to work together, know what is common practice, and know how to get a deal in contract as soon as possible.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Step 9</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Contract is drawn up and sent to buyer&rsquo;s attorney.</strong>&nbsp;The seller&rsquo;s attorney will draft the initial contract and send it to over to your attorney. The attorneys will go back &amp; forth until they are in agreement on all terms, conditions, contingencies, language, etc. Here in Queens, this process can take anywhere from 1-3 weeks depending on how fast (or slow) the attorneys work.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PRO TIP: We have also seen a lot of deals die during this process so make sure you know what your attorney is asking for, make sure that they are being responsive to the seller&rsquo;s attorney, and make sure that they are being cooperative with them as well. If you really like the property, it might not be a bad idea to express that to them so that they know that you don&rsquo;t want to lose the deal.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Step 10</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Contract terms are finalized.&nbsp;</strong>Once the contract is finalized and both attorneys are satisfied with it, your attorney will call the you in to review and sign the contract. At this time, your attorney will go through the entire contract with you and answer any questions that you have. It&rsquo;s a lot of legal jargon so you may feel overwhelmed, but rest assured that most contracts have standard language. What you want to pay attention to are the contingencies, language regarding liens &amp; violations, and any riders that are added to the contract. Once you go through everything with your attorney, you will sign the contract and cut a check for your initial escrow deposit, typically 10% of the purchase price. Remaining down payment is typically paid at closing. If you are putting down leas than 10%, the seller may require you to put the entire down payment at contract signing.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Step 11</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Half signed contract is sent to seller&rsquo;s attorney.&nbsp;</strong>Once you sign and cut the initial escrow deposit, the half signed contract along with your down payment check will be sent to the seller&rsquo;s attorney. It is usually sent via overnight mail, or on occasion the buyer&rsquo;s agent will pick it up and hand deliver it. We&rsquo;ve seen deals die at this point too because in Queens, no offer is considered fully accepted until contracts are fully executed (i.e. signed kn both sides). As a result, it is very important for you to know that until contracts are fully executed, new offers will continue to be presented to the sellers and unfortunately they have every right to entertain them with no legal penalties until they sign a contract. Just another reason to make sure you move fast.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Step 12</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Contract is fully executed.</strong>&nbsp;Once the seller&rsquo;s attroney receives the half signed contract, they will call the seller(s) in to review and sign the contract as well. Once the seller(s) sign, you will have a fully executed contract of sale (FECOS). At this point, you are both locked in to the contract and the goal is to get the deal to a closing as soon as possible. In our experience, as long as the proper due diligence and qualifying were done in advance, then there is no reason why you shouldn&rsquo;t be able to close.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Step 13</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Start your mortgage application.&nbsp;</strong>Once you have a FECOS, you can officially start your loan application. Make sure you get all your docs in quickly so that you can expedite the application process. Your lender will ask for a million things, and it can be frustrating, but just be patient and get them in as soon as possible. Many deals that we see get dragged out are due to buyers who take too long in getting things done for their loan, or title issues that take a while to resolve. If you want to make sure you close in a reasonable amount of time, get your docs in and clear conditions as soon as your lender requests them.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Step 14</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Contract to close process begins.&nbsp;</strong>If you have a good real estate team, the transaction should be fairly smooth. If not, then you may be in for a wild ride. Make sure your real estate team is on top of things and in communication with each other to ensure a smooth transaction. If you&rsquo;re taking a loan and buying a residential property, then you can expect to close in about 2-3 months (usually closer to 3 months). If you&rsquo;re taking a loan and buying a coop apartment, then you can expect to close in about 3-4 months. No matter what, your deal will most likely take some time to close because that&rsquo;s just how it is here in Queens. Don&rsquo;t expect to close in less than 60 days because that is very rare. We always advise buyers to be conservative so plan on 3 months for residential and 4 months for coops.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PRO TIP: We&rsquo;ve seen coops take 6-12 months to close so ask the agent and management company what a realistic timeline is for that specific development.&nbsp;This will help you plan better, and it will help you decide whether or not you want to move forward with that unit. You can also ask for a list of recent sales in the building to get an idea of how long previous deals took to close.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Well, those are the 14 steps that you can expect to encounter from the moment you start your home search until you finally go into contract. Once you are under contract, there are a ton of other things that will need to get done and there are several issues that can come up but as long as you have a good real estate team in place, everything should be fine.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Have a question?

Some steps may vary depending on the type of property you buy, but in general these are the steps you can expect as you begin your home buying journey in Queens NY. Need help? Feel free to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://homeandhabitatrealty.com/contact-us\"><strong>Contact Us</strong></a>&nbsp;anytime.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Step 1</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Talk to a lender.</strong>&nbsp;If you&rsquo;re looking to buy a property in Queens, the first thing you need to do is find out if you can actually afford to buy. This can be done by getting a pre-qualification or a pre-approval. Without this step, you&rsquo;re really just shooting in the dark. You&rsquo;d be surprised, some buyers can qualify for more then they expected, and other buyers think they can get approved for more than they actually can. A mortgage lender will ask you about your income, financial statements, credit, employment history, other properties owned, etc. Many people do this years before they buy because even if the mortgage lender tells you that you can&rsquo;t get a loan, at least you will know what you need to do in order to become qualified. They will tell you what to do to get on the path to homeownership and that is a key first step. If you need any lender recommendations, we have plenty.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Step 2</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Talk to an agent.</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;Once you find out if you qualify for a loan, your next step should be to speak with a local agent who is full time, specializes in working with buyers, and knows the areas that you&rsquo;re looking in. They&rsquo;ll be able to tell you if what you&rsquo;re looking for is actually realistic based on your pre-approval amount.&nbsp;If so, then they will likely be able to help you find a great property. On the other hand, if your approval amount is not realistic for the areas that you&rsquo;re looking in, then a good buyer agent will be able to help you identify other areas that can still meet your lifestyle needs.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Step 3</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Schedule a buyer consultation.&nbsp;</strong>Most people skip this step but it is SO important. You&rsquo;d be surprised how much you (and your agent) can learn once you sit down to talk through your ideas, must haves, lifestyle, etc. The initial consultation usually takes about an hour and in that time, a good buyer&rsquo;s agent will ask you all sorts of questions to find out more about exactly what you&rsquo;re looking for, and whether they think it is possible to find in that in the market of that moment. The consultation is key because without one, you and your agent will be learning things one the fly and this ultimately leads to a lot of wasted time seeing properties that you have no interest in. A good buyer consultation should cut your home search in half, and if done right, you should be able to find the right property within 10 showings. FYI: Buyer consultations are typically free so you should never have to pay for one.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Step 4</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Decide to buy.</strong>&nbsp;Once you meet with an agent and go over all your needs, you should have a good idea as to whether or not you are really ready to buy. If you come to the realization that you aren&rsquo;t ready, that&rsquo;s completely normal, and at that point, what you want to do is keep preparing so that when you enter the market you can find and buy something that you&rsquo;ll be happy with. On the other hand, if you realize that you are indeed ready to buy, then the next step is to get out there and start viewing properties!&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Step 5</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Start viewing properties.</strong>&nbsp;Once you decide to buy, you can get out there &amp; actively start looking at properties. TIP: Don&rsquo;t look at anything over your budget, unless you know it&rsquo;s a pronounced buyer&rsquo;s market. Also, be open to doing some work. Truth is that houses and apartments in Queens are old and if you require a completely move-in ready home, it will likely take you years to find the right place. Our advice, if you see a property you really like and it&rsquo;s priced right, chances are someone else feels the same way so don&rsquo;t hesitate to put in a strong offer to win the bid. We&rsquo;ve seen people pay over asking price for a home and then a year or two later they already gained more than the difference in appreciation.&nbsp;We also see a lot of people who lose out on properties and then feel the regret of not being more aggressive for the property they loved. A good buyer agent will be a great partner while you view properties too because good buyer agents will point out aspects of the property that you may not see or know about.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Step 6</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Make and negotiate offers</strong>. Once you see a property you like, you&rsquo;ll probably want to make an offer. This is where it&rsquo;s very important that you understand agency because a seller&rsquo;s agent (or listing agent) will always want you to pay the most money possible, while a buyer&rsquo;s agent will be able to help you determine the right offer price, analyze the market, share comps with you, give you their opinion, etc. Only a buyer&rsquo;s agent that you have hired to represent you can do that, a broker or seller&rsquo;s agent will not be able to.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Step 7</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Schedule inspection &amp; do your due diligence.&nbsp;</strong>Once you have an accepted offer, it&rsquo;s time for you and your agent to do some due diligence. This includes things like conducting a home inspection, checking for open violations, non-permitted items, certificate of occupancies, etc. A good buyer&rsquo;s agent will help you with this. A seller&rsquo;s agent, broker&rsquo;s agent, or non-experienced agent will most likely not help much with this type of due diligence.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Step 8</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Hire a real estate attorney.&nbsp;</strong>Once you have an accepted offer you should start vetting attorneys because as soon as you get through the due diligence period, you will need to notify them. At this point, the listing agent will ask you or your agent for your attorney&rsquo;s contact info and they will include it on the deal sheet which goes out to both buyer and seller attorneys.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PRO TIP: Make sure you use a Real Estate Attorney.

If so, simply fill out the form below and we&rsquo;ll connect you with one of our preferred lenders ASAP. Rest assured that we&rsquo;ve known these lenders for years and we trust them to do right by all of our buyers. Depending on where you are in the process, they&rsquo;ll be able to give you free advice, help you get on the path to homeownership, or get you pre-approved, if you&rsquo;re ready 🙂</p>', '<p>Buying a Home, Coop, or Condo in Queens is much different than buying a house in other parts of the country. One thing in particular that you will find a lot of in Queens, are multi-family properties, specifically 1, 2, and 3 family homes. Multi family homes can be a great financial investment because of the rent rates, appreciation, cash flow, etc. With that said, below are some of our top items to look for when buying a multi family property in Queens&hellip;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>1. Number of Boilers &ndash;</strong>&nbsp;When shopping for a 1-3 family home, you definitely want to know how many boilers the property have because that will determine your monthly heating expense. Ideally, you would want a property that has separate meters for each unit, that way renters will be responsible for paying their own heating bills. If you pursue a property with only one boiler, you will be stuck paying the entire heating bill for the building, or you will need to have it converted to separate them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>2. Age of Boiler(s) &ndash;</strong>&nbsp;Along with knowing how many boilers are in the property, you also want to know the age of them because if they&rsquo;re very old, you will most likely need to replace them soon. Boilers can be very expensive so you either want a discount for old boilers, or ideally, purchase a property with fairly new ones.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>3. Number of Electric Meters &ndash;</strong>&nbsp;Same as with boilers, you want to know how many electric meters are in the property because if there are separate meters, your tenant(s) will be responsible for paying their own electric bill. However, if there is only one electric meter, your monthly expenses will be increased because you&rsquo;ll be stuck with the entire electric bill, or you&rsquo;ll need to have it converted to separate them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>4. Age of Roof &ndash;</strong>&nbsp;Roof replacements can be one of the most expensive home improvements so you definitely want to know how old the roof is when your house hunting for a multi family in Queens. If there is an existing warranty on the roof, you also want to request that it be transferred to you in case anything happens. Ideally you want a fairly new roof, but if it is at the end of it&rsquo;s life span, just make sure the discount is reflected into the price.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>5. Rent Rates &ndash;</strong>&nbsp;Make sure that you know what current rent rates in the area. Your rental income will be the revenue for the property, so the more accurately you can project rent rates, the more accurate your investment calculations will be. A good buyer specialist will know rent rates for several different neighborhoods around Queens.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>6. Parking Spaces/Garages &ndash;</strong>&nbsp;Parking spaces lead to the opportunity for more income because each space can be rented out as well. So, when buying a 1-3 family home in Queens, you want to make sure that you&rsquo;re factoring in the potential income from parking spaces and garages.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>7. Proximity to Train &ndash;</strong>&nbsp;When buying a hold property in Queens, it&rsquo;s all about transportation. So, if you are within at least half a mile from a train station, you will significantly decrease your vacancy rates. Properties close to the train rent quicker because the demand is always there, on the flip side, if you purchase a property further out from the train, you will experience slightly longer vacancy rates.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>8. Cash Flow &ndash;</strong>&nbsp;Cash flow is king. Make sure that your property cash flows from the beginning so that you don&rsquo;t have to come out of pocket in the future. Your monthly rental income should pay for all your monthly expenses (including mortgage principal, interest, taxes, insurance, utilities, etc) and leave you with a surplus at the end of each month. If you don&rsquo;t cash flow at least one dollar, then your maximum offer should change.</p>', '<ul>\r\n	<li>\r\n	<h3><a href=\"https://www.queenshometeam.com/calculators/?CALCULATORID=HF01&amp;TEMPLATE_ID=www.queenshometeam.com_2\" target=\"_blank\">Should I refinance?</a></h3>\r\n	</li>\r\n	<li>\r\n	<h3><a href=\"https://www.queenshometeam.com/calculators/?CALCULATORID=HF02&amp;TEMPLATE_ID=www.queenshometeam.com_2\" target=\"_blank\">How much will my fixed rate mortgage payment be?</a></h3>\r\n	</li>\r\n	<li>\r\n	<h3><a href=\"https://www.queenshometeam.com/calculators/?CALCULATORID=HF03&amp;TEMPLATE_ID=www.queenshometeam.com_2\" target=\"_blank\">How much will my adjustable rate mortgage payments be?</a></h3>\r\n	</li>\r\n	<li>\r\n	<h3><a href=\"https://www.queenshometeam.com/calculators/?CALCULATORID=HF04&amp;TEMPLATE_ID=www.queenshometeam.com_2\" target=\"_blank\">How much will my payments be for a balloon mortgage?</a></h3>\r\n	</li>\r\n	<li>\r\n	<h3><a href=\"https://www.queenshometeam.com/calculators/?CALCULATORID=HF05&amp;TEMPLATE_ID=www.queenshometeam.com_2\" target=\"_blank\">Should I rent or buy?</a></h3>\r\n	</li>\r\n	<li>\r\n	<h3><a href=\"https://www.queenshometeam.com/calculators/?CALCULATORID=HF06&amp;TEMPLATE_ID=www.queenshometeam.com_2\" target=\"_blank\">Which mortgage is better for me?</a></h3>\r\n	</li>\r\n	<li>\r\n	<h3><a href=\"https://www.queenshometeam.com/calculators/?CALCULATORID=HF07&amp;TEMPLATE_ID=www.queenshometeam.com_2\" target=\"_blank\">How much will I save by increasing my mortgage payment?</a></h3>\r\n	</li>\r\n	<li>\r\n	<h3><a href=\"https://www.queenshometeam.com/calculators/?CALCULATORID=HF08&amp;TEMPLATE_ID=www.queenshometeam.com_2\" target=\"_blank\">How much mortgage might I qualify for?</a></h3>\r\n	</li>\r\n	<li>\r\n	<h3><a href=\"https://www.queenshometeam.com/calculators/?CALCULATORID=HF09&amp;TEMPLATE_ID=www.queenshometeam.com_2\" target=\"_blank\">How much home can I afford?</a></h3>\r\n	</li>\r\n	<li>\r\n	<h3><a href=\"https://www.queenshometeam.com/calculators/?CALCULATORID=PC10&amp;TEMPLATE_ID=www.queenshometeam.com_2\" target=\"_blank\">Should I consolidate my loans?</a></h3>\r\n	</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Calculator disclaimer</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The information provided by these calculators is intended for illustrative purposes only and is not intended to purport actual user-defined parameters.

So, here we will break it down and give you an idea so that you understand exactly what this term means here in in Queens.\r\n\r\nThe real estate term we’re referencing today is “Accepted Offer”. So what does an “accepted offer” mean here in Queens? In other parts of the country, when the seller accepts your offer it is typically binding and formally accepted meaning that at that point, the buyer is usually locked in to the deal. In other parts of the country you typically put money down with your offer and that locks your offer in. In addition, other parts of the country are not attorney states so that makes the accepted offer to contract phase much quicker.\r\n\r\nFree Home Valuation Queens NY\r\nNow, here in Queens and New York State in general, the difference is that an accepted offer is just a verbal acceptance and non-binding so here in Queens, even if a seller accepts a buyer’s offer, it is not legally binding. We have a saying here which we put everywhere and make very clear to potential buyers and agents which is, “no offer is considered fully accepted until contracts are signed.” Whether you are a buyer or seller, this is the most important phrase that you need to know and keep in mind whenever you’re dealing with offers on properties.\r\n\r\nIf you are a Queens home seller, no offer is considered fully accepted until contracts are signed so even after you accept an offer, you can continue to show the property and field offers until contracts are signed. On that same token, if you accept and offer and the buyer finds another place or decides to back out, they are well within their rights to do so. Now, if you are a Queens home buyer, you should be aware that no offer is considered fully accepted until contracts are signed so if a seller receives a higher offer, they are within their rights to entertain it. As a result, your priority as a buyer once you have an accepted offer, is to move quickly to contract so that you can protect your accepted offer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFree Consultation\r\nThis is why it is so important to move quickly once you have an accepted offer. Time is of the essence when you receive an accepted offer, especially if the market is favoring sellers. Either way, being that your accepted offer is not protected, you want to do your inspection within 24-48 hours in order to expedite the process. Once you do your inspection, you want to review the report, address any major issues, and get your attorney ready so that you can go into contract immediately.\r\n\r\nWe’ve seen a lot of buyers lose deals and many times it is because the buyers move to slow. Buyers who drag their feet, take too long to do an inspection, have attorneys who work very slowly, etc. have a high risk of losing their accepted offer. The important thing as a buyer is to make sure you move quickly because that will also show the seller that you are doing everything in your power to move quickly into contract.\r\n\r\nAs for sellers, the only advice we have for you regarding accepted offers is to not be afraid to accept in a good offer even if it comes in shortly after hitting the market. If you receive a good offer within the first 2-3 weeks of listing, sellers shouldn’t be concerned about accepting an offer because aside from the fact that it may be your best offer, you will still be able to show and entertain offers until contracts are fully accepted.\r\n\r\nFree Local Market Report Queens NY\r\nAgain, the most important phrase to remember is “no offer is considered fully accepted until contracts are signed.” Keep that in mind as you navigate the Queens real estate market. Buyers, move quickly when you get an accepted offer, and sellers, make sure your agent keeps showing the property after your first accepted offer because that will protect you in the event that the buyer backs out.

(2, 'upload/faq-image/img_1620713198_609a1eee64a31.jpg', 'When does the Home Inspection take place in Queens NYC?', 'when-does-the-home-inspection-take-place-in-queens-nyc-mijci', 'Today we’re answering a question that we get on occasion from Queens home buyers and sellers, especially when this is their first time buying or selling a property in NY. The question we’re talking about is, “When does the home inspection happen here in Queens?”.\r\n\r\nSo when does the inspection happen here in Queens? First off, it’s important to understand that in other parts of the country, home inspections happen at different times. For example, right across the bridge in New Jersey, you go into contract first and then you conduct your home inspection. However, here in Queens, and NY in general, you can expect for the home inspection to take place after you have an accepted offer. So, as soon as a seller accepts a buyer’s offer to purchase, that is typically when the home inspection would be scheduled.\r\n\r\nFree Listing Consultation with Queens Team at Keller Williams Realty Landmark II\r\nAs a home buyer, you want to move quickly to get your home inspection done because this is a crucial window of time in the process. The reason why is because here in NY, no offer is considered fully accepted until contracts are signed. So, ideally you would want to have your inspection scheduled and conducted within a day or two of having your offer accepted. Once the inspection is done, it usually takes a day or two for the buyer to receive the report. Once the buyer receives their report, they will review it in detail and then either give the green light to proceed, or they will bring up issues that can lead to renegotiation, credits, or deal cancellation.\r\n\r\nWhat you want to keep in mind as a home buyer is that most homes in Queens will have a lot of normal wear and tear. Remember that most homes in Queens were built in the early – mid 1900’s so almost any house you consider buying will have wear and tear. If you do bring up any issues after inspection, make sure it is for reasonable/big ticket items.\r\n\r\nFree Home Buyer Consultation\r\nIf anything major comes up in the report, then buyer and seller should reasonably expect for a renegotiation to occur. In our experience, as long as buyer and seller are both reasonable, then a new win win agreement should be attainable. On the other hand, if either party is unreasonable with their demands, then that will most likely lead to a cancellation in the deal. Some examples of major items that come up during inspections are: Roof issues, Boiler issues, Plumbing issues, Heating Issues, Electrical issues, Safety or Hazardous Issues, etc. The main purpose of an inspection is to assess the major components of a property so keep that in mind when you hire an inspector, or when you are selling.\r\n\r\nIf you are a home buyer and the inspector brings up major issues with any of the major components in the home, then you may have a chance to renegotiate in lieu of those items. And if you are a home seller, keep in mind that there are certain things that buyers will not know about until they have an inspector go through the home. So if any issues come up with one of the major components of the home, be reasonable, be understanding, and remember that those issues will likely come up with future buyers’ inspections. We never negotiate for normal wear and tear, but if something major comes up which noone knew about, then it makes sense to come to a new agreement that makes sense for all parties.\r\n\r\n\r\nNow, once the inspection is done and everyone is in agreement to move forward, that is when the attorneys would get involved. After inspection is done and green light is given from the buyer side, that is when both buyer and seller attorneys are contacted and the contract is sent out. This process from accepted offer to contract going out can take about a week or two depending on how long it takes for the buyer to schedule their inspection and receive their report. So for example, if a buyer has their offer accepted on Monday, you would generally want the inspection to be conducted on Tuesday or Wednesday so that the buyers can receive their report on Wednesday or Thursday, and then ideally the contract would be able to go out by Friday or Monday morning. Keep that in mind so that you know what to expect. Once the contract goes out, it can take another week or two before the contract is finalized and signed by both buyer and seller. So total timeline from accepted offer to contract signing can be about 2-3 weeks.\r\n\r\nSomething important to note is that during that window of time, a seller can legally continue to show the property and field new offers. So, just because you have an accepted offer, does not mean that your offer is legally binding. Even if you schedule an pay for an inspection, it is still not legally binding. And even if a contract is drawn up and signed by the buyer, it is still not legally binding. The only time an accepted offer becomes legally binding is when the buyer and seller sign, also known as a fully executed contract of sale. If you’re a home buyer, the quicker you move the better the chances of you keeping the house and not losing it to another buyer. If you are a seller, it is also in your best interest to move quickly towards a contract because your buyer can also back out at any point before contract execution.\r\n\r\nSo to answer the question, when is the inspection done here in Queens? The answer is after accepted offer and before contract is sent out. Hope that answers the question and gives you more insight into the home inspection and accepted offer process.

Whether you&rsquo;re thinking of selling now or in the future, you&rsquo;ve probably wondered what the steps to selling are and what you should do in preparation for the sale. Fortunately for you we&rsquo;ve sold over 200 houses in Queens so we&rsquo;re extremely familiar with the process, and we understand all of the steps involved for different scenarios, situations and property types.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With that said, below are 24 of the most common steps involved with selling a house in Queens NY. Some steps may vary, but most of these will apply every time. If you have any questions or would like some advice on selling, feel free to contact us anytime.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Step 1</h3>\r\n\r\n<h3>Find out How much your Home is Worth</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The first step to selling a house in Queens is obviously knowing how much the property is worth. This valuation is vital because it helps you and your family plan for the next steps with a realistic sale price expectation. You can go about this in one of two ways: 1) You can hire an independent appraiser to conduct an appraisal for you (this typically costs about $300-$400). Or 2) You can have a local Realtor come by and tell you what the property is worth (typically free of charge). If you decide to go the Realtor route, make sure you get at least three opinions because some agents are more thorough than others. Either way, this should give you a good idea of the value. Also, keep in mind that &ldquo;Appraised Value&rdquo; is different from &ldquo;Market Value&rdquo; so the objective is just to get an idea of the appraised value. Ultimately you won&rsquo;t know the true &ldquo;market value&rdquo; until you hit the market and open the bidding up to all interested parties. This is your first step in knowing how to sell your house in queens ny.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Step 2</h3>\r\n\r\n<h3>Calculate your Net Profit, Potential Tax Burden, Tax Options, etc.</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Once you have a good idea of the property&rsquo;s value, the next thing you want to do is find out how much you would walk away with after the sale. This is the number that really matters because your net profit is what you will have left over to proceed with the next chapter in your life. Seller closing costs in Queens include: NYC transfer taxes, NYS transfer taxes, your Attorney fee(s), Listing broker commission, Buyer broker commission, Mortgage payoff(s), Home Equity Loan Payoff(s), Title Fees, etc. Once you have an idea of your estimated net profit, you can then speak with a tax advisor regarding your potential tax burden (i.e. Capital Gains) and different Tax Options available (i.e. 1031 exchange). For a complete breakdown of this step on How to Sell your House in Queens NY,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.queenshometeam.com/help\">contact us</a>&nbsp;and we can send you a Queens closing costs spreadsheet.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Step 3</h3>\r\n\r\n<h3>Decide whether or not to Sell</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>At this point, you should have a family discussion and decide whether now is indeed the right time to sell. You should have all of the information you need to make this decision so it ultimately comes down to selling, or holding. Try not to speculate as to where the market is going to be 1 month, 6 months, or 1 year from now because at the end of the day, it is just that, speculation. We tell all of the homeowners we meet, selling is all about timing. Usually when people sell, it is because they are ready to unload their property, take their equity, and move in to a new chapter. Either that, or they are in a situation that requires them to sell. Either way, the decision to sell is usually pretty clear.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Step 4</h3>\r\n\r\n<h3>Get your Ducks in a Row</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Once you&rsquo;ve decided to sell, now you need to get your things in order. A lot of these Queens&rsquo; houses are very old, and depending on whether you inherited the property or purchased it, there are a lot of documents that you want to gather in order to streamline the sale. You definitely want to locate your old title report, your property deed, any mortgage records, payoff statements, ownership/transfer documents, violation documents, lien documents, wills, administration/probate documents, surveys, certificate of occupancies, etc.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Tips: If you are handling an estate sale, you will need to make sure that the proper probate or administration proceeding is filed with the surrogates court before listing the house. If the person who passed away lived out of state and the probate was done in that state, you will still need to file an ancillary probate in New York State so you will need to get that filed before listing. If you are a non-resident of New York, you will need to pay capital gains at closing so you should get an idea of the amount from a local CPA. If you have tenants, you should notify them of the sale asap and if they don&rsquo;t have a lease or the lease has ended, we would advise sending a notice of termination and starting a holdover case if necessary.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We have seen so many issues pop up because these things were not looked into ahead of time.

We do this for all of our seller clients because it allows us to take care of minor repairs, makes us aware of major issues, and it also gives us all some piece of mind knowing what to expect once a buyer schedules their own inspection. Our inspector likes to say &ldquo;it&rsquo;s always cheaper to resolve issues yourself rather then having to renegotiate once they come up in an inspection report.&rdquo; For help on this step of how to sell your house in Queens NY, visit our Home Maintenance site&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.homekeepr.com/join/queens-hometeam\">www.homekeepr.com/join/queens-hometeam</a>. There you will find a list of home inspectors that we use for Queens home inspections.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Step 6</h3>\r\n\r\n<h3>Make Repairs and Declutter</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Once you have your pre inspection done, the next step should be to take care of any minor/affordable fixes. You obviously are not going to take care of big issues like roofing, plumbing, electrical, etc. but if you have some small issues that can be easily resolved, you will just have less things to worry about or renegotiate once your buyer gets their own inspection done. If you don&rsquo;t make repairs, then once the buyer&rsquo;s inspection report comes back they will most likely try to get you down on the price, and buyers don&rsquo;t talk in hundreds, it&rsquo;s always thousands.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In addition to minor repairs, you also want to de-clutter. We tell all of our clients, you have to have it empty before closing anyway so better to get a head start in the beginning because it will help the property show better.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Step 7</h3>\r\n\r\n<h3>Order a Deep Cleaning</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>No matter if your property is owner occupied, tenant occupied, or vacant it is always a good idea to have a deep cleaning done before you start letting people in to see it. You&rsquo;d be surprised but it makes a big difference. Even if the house needs work it will make the house smell and look better which means better offers. We do this for all of our listings and it&rsquo;s well worth the investment. This is a very important step on how to sell your house in Queens NY because you can almost guarantee that most of your competition will not be doing this.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Step 8</h3>\r\n\r\n<h3>Schedule Staging (if necessary)</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>If you are currently living in your home and(or) if there is already furniture in place throughout the home, then staging should definitely be on your to do list. Knowing how to sell your house in Queens NY means knowing how to present it to the public. Now, I&rsquo;m not suggesting you go hire a professional stager to bring in furniture &amp; fixtures, but you should definitely get some design help to make sure it looks as nice as possible. What we do for all of our clients is bring in an interior designer who gives the client homework to do before she stages the house for photos. This usually includes a lot of tasks that although may seem like a lot, are actually very manageable. Once the homework is complete, we schedule the designer/stager to come in and stage the house for photos. This usually involves rearranging of furniture, removal of large items, adding accent pieces, etc. This step makes all the difference in the world, and every time we&rsquo;ve done it, it has helped us sell quicker, and for more money.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Step 9</h3>\r\n\r\n<h3>Hire your Agent or Team</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Okay, so this step could actually be your first step as well if you have a really good agent. For example, we usually meet with homeowners to tell them how much their home is worth, and then if they decide to sell, we guide them through all of the following steps. However, if you complete all the previous steps on your own, then the next step would be to find your real estate agent or team. You need to find and hire the agent or team that will represent you in the sale, market the property to agents/buyers, negotiate on your behalf, push the deal from contract to close, and ultimately guide you through the whole process. Naturally you will probably ask friends &amp; family for recommendations, and you may even do some research online to see who has the best reviews. Either way, we always suggest to meet with at least three separate agents or teams so that you can compare service plans and selling strategies of each. The one important thing to note here is that companies don&rsquo;t matter. Trust us, the company doesn&rsquo;t mean as much as the agents themselves because they are the ones that are going to have all the local knowledge and do all of the work. Most agents have access to MLS and most companies offer listing syndication for their brokerage&rsquo;s listings. What you really need to find is a great agent or real estate team that you feel comfortable with and confident in to help you sell. A strong agent or team will be able to guide you through this step as well as the entire process of how to sell your house in Queens NY.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Step 10</h3>\r\n\r\n<h3>Determine the List Price</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>So, once you hire your agent or team, the next step is to rerun comps and local market conditions to see what the best list price will be. In our industry we have a saying &ldquo;comps are only good for two weeks&rdquo;, in other words, when you sit with a Queens real estate professional to find out how much your home is worth, you are finding out what it is worth on that day based on data available at that point in time. Things change all the time, and when you decide to sell, other listings and other market conditions can affect the value of your house.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For example, if your neighbor lists their house for less than what you intend to list for and that house is very similar to yours, chances are you will just sell their listing instead of yours. Or, if an identical house across the street from you closes around the time you plan to list, this also affects your value and eventual bank appraisal. For this reason, before you hit the market it&rsquo;s important to review everything once again, especially the other competing listings on the market in your neighborhood. Determining the right list price is arguably the most vital step in knowing how to sell your house in queens ny.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Step 11</h3>\r\n\r\n<h3>Schedule professional photos and target a list date</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The next thing you want to do (once you have your list price ready) is schedule the photography session and actual list date. You want to make sure you have professional photos taken, no if, ands, or buts about it, trust me. Then, what you want to do is make sure you pick a good day/week to hit the market. Avoid holiday weekends as those weekends are usually slower in terms of buyer search traffic, and ideally, I would suggest listing on a Monday or Tuesday. This allows you at least 4-5 days to implement all of your marketing efforts for the first open house.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Step 12</h3>\r\n\r\n<h3>Schedule First Open House(s)</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Once you have your list date set, the next thing you want to do is schedule the first open house(s). It&rsquo;s important to note that an open house is not going to get your home sold, maybe back in the day, but not in this day &amp; age. You can already imagine that most home buyers search for properties online, so, you&rsquo;re not going to find your buyer from the open house sign itself, rather, an open house is just a convenient time for all buyers and agents to see the new listing. It also helps create urgency if you market it effectively and generate a good turnout.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Step 13</h3>\r\n\r\n<h3>Get the Word Out</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Once you have your photos taken, open house date(s) set, and officially hit the market, it&rsquo;s time to spread the word. Ideally, what you want to do is hold off all showings until the first open house and in order to make sure it is a success, you have to let EVERYONE know about the new listing so that they can come by that weekend. This has been our strategy for a long time and it has helped us sell a lot of properties at and above asking price. Ultimately, if the property is priced right and marketed well, then you should have a good turnout at the first open house. If the turnout is good, then you will most likely create urgency among the buyers since they would have all seen how many people were at the open house and as a result, they would feel like this is a hot property that will go quickly. Now, in order to spread the word and drive traffic to the first showings, you have to make sure you do these things.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>1) Make sure the property is listed on the Multiple Listing Service of Long Island (MLSLI).</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Most Queens&rsquo; agents are members of this MLS, but most Manhattan and Brooklyn agents are not.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FYI: If your MLS number starts with a number, then you are all set. However, if your MLS # starts with an asterisk (*), then your agent put the property up as an &ldquo;office exclusive&rdquo; and this will totally limit your exposure.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>2) Make sure the property is listed on the Real Estate Board of New York (REBNY).</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Most Manhattan and Brooklyn agents are members of REBNY, but most Queens&rsquo; agents are not.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>3) Make sure your property is listed on On-Line Residential (OLR). This is another listing portal that NYC agents use.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Not every agent can get your listing on OLR so you have to make sure that your agent has the ability to do so.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>4) Make sure your property is listed on the Brooklyn Multiple Listing Service (BNYMLS).&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Most Brooklyn agents are members of this MLS, but most Queens and Manhattan agents are not.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>5) Make sure your property is showing up EVERYWHERE online.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Most MLS&rsquo;s will syndicate your property to other real estate websites like Zillow, Streeteasy, Trulia, Realtor.com, Redfin, etc. So, in order to make sure your property is being syndicated properly, all you have to do is Google your address and you will see if it is showing up. TIP: Google your address with and without dashes because some websites use them and some do not. While you&rsquo;re at it, make sure all of the information is accurate, and make sure that the listing looks good.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>6) Make sure your agent is telling their entire office &amp; network about it.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you hire a top selling agent, then chances are that they have a large database of potential buyers for your property. In addition, if they are a high producing listing agent, they will probably have a large network of buyer agents who will most likely have several potential buyers for your property.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>7) Make sure your agent is Cobroking.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Unfortunately this one is a little hard to do because you can&rsquo;t be with your agent while they&rsquo;re answering the phones and fielding inquiries on your property, however, you can definitely tell your agent that you want to make sure that he (or she) is Cobroking. Make sure they know that your main objective is to have maximum exposure so that you can get the most offers possible. When you hire an agent to sell your house they owe you Loyalty and Obedience so as long as they understand their fiduciary duties, they should have no problem cooperating with other agents who have buyers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Step 14</h3>\r\n\r\n<h3>Prepare house for showing</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Okay, now you have your property officially on the market at a list price that is right on the money. People have been calling to get in to see the house but you aren&rsquo;t showing until the first open house. Buyers and agents are really excited about the house because it&rsquo;s priced right and looks amazing from the professional pictures online. Now you have the open house coming up and your next job will be preparing the house for showings. The goal here is to have people walk into the pictures you posted online. The cleaning will help the place smell good, and the staging will help it show well as people tour the house. Ultimately, you want to create urgency and evoke the emotions necessary for buyers to make offers. If you do all this properly, you should have multiple offers by Monday 🙂</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Step 15</h3>\r\n\r\n<h3>Follow up with Open House attendees</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Okay, so if you followed all of the steps so far, you should already have a few offers in your hand and more on the way. You now have to follow up with everyone (agents and buyers) who came to the open house because you need to know how they felt about the house (i.e. Feedback) and obviously, if they would like to make an offer. Whatever you do, don&rsquo;t respond to any offers until after you follow up with all open house attendees. Ideally, after following up with all parties you have multiple offers and then you can move on to the next step.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Step 16</h3>\r\n\r\n<h3>Field and Negotiate Offers</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Okay, so at this point you should have multiple offers on the table and a few of them are probably hounding you for an update. At this point, you want to get back to everyone individually to acknowledge receipt of their offer, and let them know how these offers will be handled. It&rsquo;s up to you as to how you want to handle the offers, but my suggestion would be to ask for highest &amp; best from each interested party. The best way to go about this is to let the buyers/agents know that there are multiple offers on the table and you are asking for highest and best offers by end of day on X date. Be sure to let them know that their offer should be submitted in writing, with a pre-approval, and proof of funds. If you want to take it a step further, you can also ask for credit scores and first page of last two years tax returns. In any case, after you receive all highest and best offers, you will want to review them with your agent or family and discuss which offer has the best price with the best terms. After reviewing all offers and financial documents, it&rsquo;s time to pick one and formally accept an offer!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>NOTE:<br />\r\nIf you don&rsquo;t have multiple offers, you will need to negotiate directly with the one potential buyer you have.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Step 17</h3>\r\n\r\n<h3>Schedule Buyer&rsquo;s Inspection or Conduct Financial Review</h3>\r\n\r\n<p><em>For Residential: Once offer is accepted schedule buyer&rsquo;s home inspection.&nbsp;</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Congratulations, you have your first accepted offer! But don&rsquo;t crack open that wine bottle yet because you still have a lot of work to do. First off, you have to schedule the buyer&rsquo;s home inspection as soon as possible. Sometimes buyers drag their feet at this point so you want to create urgency and make sure that they move fast. Being that you probably have multiple back ups, this should not be difficult. If for some reason you don&rsquo;t have multiple back ups, then you don&rsquo;t have much leverage and may just have to wait for them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>For Coops: Once offer is accepted, it is time to conduct a full financial review.&nbsp;</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you just accepted an offer on your Coop, then what you need to do next is a full financial review. This is non-negotiable because not only do they need to get passed the management company, but more importantly, they need to get approved by the board. So, you just need to make sure they look good on paper and don&rsquo;t have any circumstances or situations that will raise eyebrows when the pacakage is presented. Here&rsquo;s what you need to request and look at for the financial review:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>First page of last two yrs tax returns &ndash; To verify adjusted gross income for past two years.</li>\r\n	<li>Last two yrs W-2s, 1099s, K-1s, etc &ndash; To verify gross wages and employment history.</li>\r\n	<li>Last month pay stubs &ndash; To verify current employer and base pay.</li>\r\n	<li>Current position &amp; length of employment &ndash; Not a formal letter of employment, you just need to know their current position and length of employment with the current Company.</li>\r\n	<li>Full credit report &ndash; To calculate Debt-to-Income ratio</li>\r\n	<li>Proof of funds &ndash; To verify down pmt as well as reserves to show after the sale.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>If anything here looks off or concerning to you, you can almost guarantee that it would do the same when presented to the board. The highest offer is not always the best candidate, and when it comes to selling Coops, you ALWAYS want to go with the best candidate. If for some reason they don&rsquo;t meet specific Coop requirements, or if they have some items in their financial review that can be a cause for concern, then you may want to go on to the first back up offer and perform the financial review for them. Repeat these steps until you have an acceptable offer price with solid financials from a qualified candidate.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://www.queenshometeam.com/help\">Contact Us</a>&nbsp;if you have any questions about How to Sell your House in Queens NY</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Step 18</h3>\r\n\r\n<h3>Prepare to renegotiate after inspection</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Now, you schedule the inspection, and since you did a pre-inspection, you should already be prepared as to what you can expect. The buyer&rsquo;s inspection report comes back, and most likely they will try to renegotiate. You go back and forth on a few items and then ideally find a win win so you can move on to the next step!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you get into a renegotiation after inspection and cannot come to an agreement, then the deal will die and you will need to start over with a new buyer (if you have back up offers) or back to showing if not.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Step 19</h3>\r\n\r\n<h3>Begin vetting real estate Attorneys</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>You can probably start doing this as soon as you start receiving offers if you want to get a head start on it. The main thing you want to do is call the real estate attorneys that you&rsquo;re vetting and feel them out to see who you feel most comfortable with. You also want to know how much they charge for a real estate transaction. Typical cost in Queens is somewhere between $1,000 &ndash; $1,500. You can find a list of our preferred real estate attorneys at:&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.homekeepr.com/join/queens-hometeam\">www.homekeepr.com/join/queens-hometeam</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Step 20</h3>\r\n\r\n<h3>Proceed with Contract or move on to back up offers/showings if necessary</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>For Residential: At this point in the process, you have an accepted offer and the buyers received their inspection report. They probably tried to renegotiate on some items and as long as the requests were reasonable, you were most likely able to find a win win to keep the deal going forward. If for some reason the requests from the buyer were outrageous or unreasonable, you may have to go to the first back up and start the inspection process over again, just keep in mind that whatever items the first buyer&rsquo;s inspection turned up will most likely come up with the next buyer too. Repeat these steps until you are able to come to an agreement after inspection and move on to the next steps.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For Coops: If you&rsquo;re selling a Coop and did the financial review, hopefully everything looks clean and the buyer looks good on paper so you can now move on to the next step.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://www.queenshometeam.com/help\">Contact Us</a>&nbsp;if you have any questions about How to Sell your House in Queens NY</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Step 21</h3>\r\n\r\n<h3>If all in agreement, contact Attorney with a fully completed deal sheet</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Okay, you got passed the inspection or financial review, everything looks good, all parties are in agreement, and now you&rsquo;re ready to go into contract. At this point, you should have your real estate attorney ready, and you should ask the buyer(s)/buyer&rsquo;s agent for the buyer&rsquo;s real estate attorney info. Now you have to prepare what&rsquo;s called a &ldquo;Deal Sheet&rdquo;. This is a one page document that outlines all price, terms, and conditions of the offer along with buyer name, seller name, attorney info, lender info, property details, etc. Once you have the fully completed deal sheet ready, it is then sent to your real estate attorney who will use the details to draw up the contract.!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Step 22</h3>\r\n\r\n<h3>Contract is sent to Buyer&rsquo;s attorney</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Once the contract is drawn up, it is then sent over to the buyer&rsquo;s attorney who will review the contract and most likely make some revisions. Prepare for the attorneys to go back and forth because they have to agree on all the terms, conditions, and wording in the actual contract. Sometimes they can take a while just push the deal if they&rsquo;re taking too long. If there are any major contract items that need addressing or were not part of the original agreement, you will know and most likely need to get everyone back on the same page. Either way, the idea here is to make sure nobody kills the deal with petty requests or legal jargon that nobody is in agreement with. The good news is that typically Attorneys are able to work together to come to an agreement on the contract. Every once in a while we come across attorneys (typically not Queens&rsquo; real estate attorneys) who take it upon themselves to make outrageous and unreasonable requests which can lead to big issues and possibly the deal being cancelled. If you find yourself in a situation where your attorney is doing this, you may want to switch attorneys asap.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Step 23</h3>\r\n\r\n<h3>Once all parties are in agreement, buyer(s) are called in to review and sign contract</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>So now we&rsquo;re getting somewhere, and it&rsquo;s almost time to celebrate a huge milestone. At this point, the Attorneys have agreed on all terms, conditions, and wording in the contract so the buyer&rsquo;s attorney calls their buyer in to review and sign the contract. Once the buyer goes in to review and sign the contract, they will need to bring their check book because they&rsquo;ll need to cut a check for the initial down pmt deposit (typically 10% of purchase price whether all cash or financing). This check is included with the half signed contract and it is then sent over to your attorney.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Step 24</h3>\r\n\r\n<h3>Contract is sent back to seller&rsquo;s attorney</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Once the half signed contract is sent back to your attorney, they will then review it to make sure everything looks good. If okay, they will then call you in to review and sign the contract as well. In the meantime, they are going to be depositing the initial down pmt deposit into their escrow account where it will remain until closing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Step 25</h3>\r\n\r\n<h3>Seller is called in to review and sign contract</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Alright, the big day is here. You followed all of the steps to selling a house in Queens NY and as a result, you were able to sell your house for a great price and all within the first two weeks! You&rsquo;ve received some other offers after this one was accepted but they came in lower or similar to what you accepted so you have piece of mind knowing that you got a really good deal. Inspection took place, and although there were some issues, you were able to find a win win and keep the deal going forward. Attorneys went back and forth for a bit, but fortunately they were getting along and working towards the same goal of getting into contract. They agreed on the contract and then the buyers were called in to sign. So, the buyer(s) signed the contract and now they&rsquo;re locked in to the deal (you can breathe a deep sigh of relief). Now, your attorney has scheduled for you to go in and sign. Once you get there, you review the contract, go over the details with your attorney, and then officially sign.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>CONGRATULATIONS YOU ARE UNDER CONTRACT!</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Unfortunately you still can&rsquo;t crack open that bottle of wine because this is only 25% of the work. The other 75% of work is done in the contract to close phase so now you have to get ready to start pushing everybody to make sure they not only do their job, but that they do it in a timely fashion so that we can reach our goal of closing on time. Regardless of which, you are under contract now and that is a huge milestone! Have a nice dinner and enjoy the relief of getting this far. Now it&rsquo;s all about follow up. I would go into those next steps, but that would make this post run on WAY too long 🙂</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Thanks for reading our step by step guide on how to sell your house in Queens NY.

The American Dream is to own a home!</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Other than the psychic benefits of being an owner rather than a renter, there are two primary financial benefits &ndash; building equity (or savings) and tax deductions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Building equity &ndash; Instead of paying rent, ownership allows you to build, over time, an equity stake in the property. Your mortgage payment goes towards interest and principal. Many people view the monthly principal payments as savings. So that when it comes time to sell, you can monazite the equity stake &ndash; or savings &ndash; you have built up over time. This compares to being a renter, where you have not built up any equity, or savings, in the property.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Tax deductions &ndash;</strong>Again, your mortgage payments are comprised of both principal and interest. The interest you pay is tax deductible, as are your real estate taxes. In houses and condominiums, real estate taxes are paid separately, whereas with cooperatives, they are embedded in the monthly maintenance payment. And in a cooperative, the corporation may also have an underlying mortgage on the property, so interest payments may also be included in the maintenance payment. Usually the tax deductibility of a cooperative&rsquo;s maintenance payment is expressed as a percentage of the total maintenance payment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Your tax savings</strong>&nbsp;are equal to the total mortgage interest and real estate taxes you pay each calendar year multiplied by your Federal marginal income tax rate. So, for example, if your interest and real estate taxes for the year totaled $10,000 and your Federal marginal income tax rate is 28%, your tax savings are the product of the two, or $2,800 per year or $233.33 per month.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>II. What is the difference between a cooperative and condominium?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>In a cooperative,</strong>you purchase shares in the corporation that owns the building. These shares entitle you to a proprietary lease that allows you to occupy the unit. You are a tenant-owner in the cooperative, and are entitled to the same tax deductions as if you owned real property (a house or condominium), namely real estate taxes and mortgage interest (for both the cooperative corporation&rsquo;s mortgage and your own mortgage). Cooperatives also have rules that specify a specific down payment percentage. This can vary from 10% t0 35% of the purchase price. Again, this is a cooperative corporation, not a bank, requirement. Cooperatives also require financial disclosure from the buyer, in the form of a comprehensive purchase application, and approval by the corporation&rsquo;s board of directors.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>The cooperative corporation issues rules,&nbsp;</strong>which may limit the right to sublet, or rent, the unit, and restrict the ownership of certain pets. There may also be what is generally known as a &ldquo;flip tax,&rdquo; an amount paid to the cooperative corporation when the unit is sold. This payment is typically borne by the seller, and is often expressed as a dollar amount per share or a percentage of the sales price.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Condominiums are considered real property,&nbsp;</strong>so you are purchasing the interior (four walls) of the unit plus a share of the common elements (hallways, basement, etc.) of the building. The condominium does not have a down payment requirement, however, your lender may require 10% down. The size of the down payment is dependent on your creditworthiness. A fairly simple purchase application is submitted, and the condominium does have the right of first refusal to purchase the unit. In virtually all transactions the condominium board signs away this right and the property proceeds to closing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>III. What are the financial requirements to purchase a house, condominium or cooperative?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Today, given the recent turmoil in the financial markets, a prospective buyer&rsquo;s financial wherewithal and solid credit history is of paramount importance. Every buyer needs to consider the following:</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Credit Scores &ndash;</strong>There are three credit rating agencies (Experian, TranUnion and Equifax) that compile information on your use of credit and issue a FICO score than ranges between 300 and 850. 850 being excellent &ndash; 300 very poor Usually, from 750 and up is what the lending institutions are looking for in this turbulent financial climate.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Should I buy or rent?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This is dependent on your needs, time horizon, and financial situation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Your needs&hellip; What a family, couple or single person may require in a home.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Your time horizon&hellip; The amount of time projected to live in a certain place.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Your financial situation&hellip; The affordable amount one can pay monthly.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>IV. How much house or apartment can I afford?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>This depends on the needs of the family coupled with the financial situation of the purchaser.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>V. How long does it take to close on a property, once my offer has been accepted?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>It could be as short as a month with an all cash purchase of a house or condo. Usually it is 60 to 90 days from accepted offer to closing. It can be longer when purchasing a coop.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>VI.

This encompasses:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Standing ready to enter broker-client relationships or to show property equally to members of all racial, religious, or ethnic groups.</li>\r\n	<li>Receiving all formal written offers and communicating them to the owner.</li>\r\n	<li>Exerting their best efforts to conclude all transactions.</li>\r\n	<li>Maintaining equal opportunity employment practices.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>2. Members, individually and collectively, in performing their agency functions, have no right or responsibility to volunteer information regarding the racial, religious, or ethnic composition of any neighborhood or any part thereof.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>3. Members shall not engage in any activity which has the purpose of inducing panic selling.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>4. Members shall not print, display, or circulate any statement or advertisement with respect to the sale or rental of a dwelling that indicates any preference, limitations, or discrimination based on race, color, religion, sex, handicap, familial status, or national origin.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>5. Members who violate the spirit or any provision of this Code for Equal Opportunity shall be subject to disciplinary action.</p>', 'upload/service-photo/img_1620549495_60979f77821f1.jpg', 'Lorem ipsum dolor stit amet consectetur adipisicing elit.

They last up to 10 times longer and use two-thirds less energy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Get Unplugged</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Most devices in standby mode will continue to use power. Unplug these devices or use a smart strip power strip that senses when appliances are off. It knows when to turn your devices on automatically &ndash; saving you time, money, and energy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Machine Washing</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>As much as 85% of the energy used to wash clothes goes to heating the water. Using cold water can help to reduce energy cost.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Thermostat Settings</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Lowering you thermostat by just one degree can reduce costs by about 4%, by lowing the thermostat just a little you can save on heat and A/C costs. Ceiling fans also help in reducing energy consumption in both the summer and winter months.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Faucets</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Low-flow water fixtures such as showerheads, faucets and toilets reduce water consumption and water heating costs by as much as 50%.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Eat smart</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Purchasing from local farmers keeps money in the local economy. Our famers market is located on 34th Avenue between 77th and 78th street every Sunday during the summer months.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bottled water</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Use a water filter to purify tap water instead of buying bottled water. It will save you money and also reduce container waste. Use a reusable water bottle when traveling or at work.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Buy smart</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Purchasing food from bulk bins can save money and reduce packaging waste.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Energy Star</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Energy Star-qualified appliances and electronics use far less energy than standard appliances and in addition reduce pollution.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Windows</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Replacing old single-pane windows with double pane-windows helps reduce heat loss in winter and heat gain in the summer. They can also help reduce noise pollution in your home.</p>', 'upload/service-photo/img_1629367234_611e2bc25fd30.jpg', 'Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet consectetur adipisicing eliit.
